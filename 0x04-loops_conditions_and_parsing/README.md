# Loops, conditions and parsing

## Description
> This repository contains scripts that are created as part of the learning objectives of programming at ALX SE programme. The emphasis is on enforcing problem solving skills through programming and other technologies. The Bash files created are for a deeper understanding of loops, conditions, and parsing in scripting.

## Learning Objectives
- How to create SSH keys
- What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements
- How to use the `cut` command
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- All files should end with a new line
- Operating system: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- The length of all files will be tested using `wc`
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- You are not allowed to use `awk`
- Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.7.0`) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
