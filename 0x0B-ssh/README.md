# SSH

## Description
> SSh (Secure Shell) is important in encryption of data across different platforms in communication with each other. Servers use SSH keys (which can be generated using different algorithms such as RSA) for establishing encrypted connections between systems. This is important in software development.

## Learning objectives
- What is a server
- Where servers usually live
- What is SSH
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- OS: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- All files are executables.
- First line of every file: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- Second line is a comment explaining the project.
