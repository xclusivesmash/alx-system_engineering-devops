# CMD (Command Line) Challenge

## Background Context
> [CMD CHALLENGE](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/a83_NOBEtXgFr1Yqej0HYA) is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

## Requirements
- Create a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels
- Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format
- How to push the screenshot to the sandbox environment using the SFTP:
    * Take the `screenshots` of the completed levels as mentioned.
    * Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
    * Use the `SFTP command-line tool` to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the `hostname`, `username`, and `password` provided to you for the sandbox environment.
    * Once connected, navigate to the `directory` where you want to upload the `screenshots`.
    * Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the `screenshots` from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
    * Confirm that the `screenshots` have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
    * Once the `screenshots` are transferred, you can proceed to push the `screenshots` to `GitHub` as mentioned in the initial requirements.
